# SnowMeltNivolet
Matlab simulation codes and input data for a Stochastic Model of Snow Melt (REFERENCE)

This repository contains the Matab simulation and accompanying data files to run the stochastic model for snow melt in a high elevation catchment, proposed in the following article:

REFERENCE

To run: type "SnowCoverArea_Main" from Matlab. A demonstration simulation will begin, in which model output will be fitted against satellite snow cover data, for 25 randomly sampled parameter sets. At the end of this fitting process, the best set will be selected and a simulation performed according to this parameter set.

You can change the various parameters, sample size, model functions etc within the scripts.
